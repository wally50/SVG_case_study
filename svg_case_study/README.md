Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

An alternative to way to display grahics (and text) in XML/HTML environments. SVGs are rendered from data stored in text format describing lines and curves, rather than a raster format (jpg, png, bmp, gif and the lilke) which has a dot matrix data structure. As such, the SVG image is scalable, without loss of image quality (pixelation). The raster image formats have limitations either in colour range, scalability or file size (to achieve better quality images at higher magnifications) While not (currently) feasible for representing photographic images, due to the nature of textualizing a shape/s and then filling, file sizes would outway that of the raster counterpart. SVGs come into their own when applied to graphic design elements such as logos and icons, for scalability, ability to be dynamic and interactive.
